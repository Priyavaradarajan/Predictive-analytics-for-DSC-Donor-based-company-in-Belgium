Algorithms used for Prediction - Logistic regression and Random Forests

Evaluation metrics - AUC, Cumulative gains adn Lift Curve

The results showed that With themodel, we can reach profits even selecting different percentages from our total population (10%, 20%).Without the model, the campaign might not yield profits and the target donators would be random
